Validator: deterministic contract + cross-reference checks for a Data2Story project.

Complements verify.py (which builds the sentence->evidence map). This script asserts the
inter-stage contracts that are otherwise enforced only by prompt instructions:

  - every analyst finding (ana_xx) carries a calculation {file, lines, output}
  - every cross-reference resolves:
        ana.based_on   -> det
        edt.findings   -> ana      edt.context -> det
        des.data_source-> ana      des.based_on -> ana      des.section -> edt (or 'teaser')
  - editor.full_triage covers every ana (nothing silently dropped)
  - instance assets copy embed_url / filename VERBATIM from detective (no ID substitution)
  - every data-ana / data-det / data-des / data-edt / data-sct in index.html exists in the JSONs
  - every scouted media item (sct_xx) has a license that permits republication (on the allowlist),
    a verified identity for real subjects, and its asset file present on disk
  - media-clip QUALITY (Section 5d; WARN, grandfather-friendly — reads only fields the Scout
    recorded, so an ABSENT field is skipped and existing blogs never regress): media_low_resolution
    (a sct_ image/video whose RECORDED native_width is below the display floor — a low-res asset
    shown upscaled looks soft, PIT-69) and media_event_unverified (a real-subject VIDEO that passed
    subject-identity but has no identity.frame_verified — the clip may show the right subject at the
    WRONG moment, PIT-70). Both WARN; neither ever blocks.
  - every re-hosted/displayed photo carries the full provenance manifest (license attribution
    text when required + a verified, named identity for real subjects)
  - every cinematic background scene (cin_xx) references a verified sct_/des_ asset (no raw imagery).
    Cinematic is a MANDATORY stage (no "off"): meta.mode is one of {photographic, generative,
    data_driven, cinematic}; only image/video scenes carry a media_ref that must resolve, while a
    data_driven chart-spine scene (kind color|gradient, no media_ref) is intentionally skipped.
    PHOTOGRAPHIC continuity (Section 6c): in photographic mode a gradient/color rest is the
    black-scroll-gap bug (PIT-54) — error on any kind:gradient|color scene and on two consecutive
    gradient rests; a rest must hold a dimmed/framed REAL photo. generative/data_driven keep gradients.
  - the Verify layer is present: verify/ dir + verify_map.json (covering every page data-* id)
    + run_cells.json + exactly one notebook, and the panel shell is pasted into index.html
    (asserted at the Stage-6 gate, BEFORE Stage 7 fills the islands)
  - dark-root robustness floor (warn): the emitted page declares color-scheme:dark
    (a :root/html rule or a <meta name="color-scheme"> with "dark") AND paints the
    html/:root background, so the UA root canvas is never the light-theme white that a
    fixed backdrop-filter element can flush the page to (the Verify-panel white-out vector)
  - publish-gate manifest: any copyrighted / demo-only / local-only asset (publish_blocker
    or license demo-only / permits_republication:false) carries a documented publishable
    swap target (publish_note); a copyrighted asset referenced with no publish_note warns
  - decorative-overlay-no-data-*: an element that is itself decorative (inline pointer-events:none)
    must NOT carry a provenance data-{ana,det,des,sct,cin,int} token (it would pollute the graph)
  - numbers-from-model (best-effort): a hardcoded display literal duplicating a provenance
    expected-value is flagged (heuristic, warn) so a stale handwritten number is caught
  - image-size cap (soft): an in-body <figure> <img> with no max-width cap warns
  - hero cover (warn; ERROR on a visual topic for the motion/loop checks): when hero.json
    declares a video hero, its assets resolve on disk, a poster + reduced-motion fallback
    are present, the .teaser overlay carries data-des, the hero <video> is inside a
    .cin-stage wrapper (Verify-toggle immunity), hero.json carries a seamless-loop `loop`
    marker (boomerang|xfade|native), and the page wires a JS autoplay-retry (a .play() call)
  - richness floor (the inverse of media breadth): on a RICH topic (topic_profile
    is_visual OR is_computational) the page may not ship impoverished — cinematic-undersupply
    (send-back), static hero on a visual topic, < 3 verified images, hollow verify cells.
    Each capability-gated; an abstract/small/privacy_sensitive dataset trips none. The
    capability-gated checks ERROR (block) on a topic the classifier marks visual/computational
    and WARN otherwise (absent-profile / privacy = exempt = advisory). The lone exception
    richness_cinematic_undersupplied stays WARN (a valid fallback shipped; it is a "go source
    more" routing signal, not a shipped-threadbare defect).
  - mandatory-stage floors (send-back): cinematic missing (no scroll background was
    produced although the cinematic stage is mandatory on every blog → Cinematographer) and
    BGM missing on EVERY blog (no front-of-blog soundtrack although BGM is mandatory with NO
    exemption — not even privacy → Scout). cinematic_missing ERRORs on a visual/computational
    topic (else warn); bgm_missing is a HARD ERROR on EVERY blog (no privacy/abstract/
    non-visual exemption — BGM is never skippable; the classical-recording floor guarantees a
    clean track always exists) whenever no BGM presence signal is found. A vinyl-marker /
    self-hosted-source advisory (warn) flags a BGM that is present but not the canonical
    spinning-vinyl card or whose source looks AI-generated. Neither ever forces a tonally-wrong
    / decorative immersion (that is the rubric cap).
  - verify-drift (warn): an exact (non-reduced-N) runnable run_cells snippet whose
    expected_stdout shares NO number with the Analyst's calculation.output for the same
    finding (after %<->fraction + separator normalisation) is flagged — the in-browser
    proof may compute a different number than the Analyst transcribed. WARN only; reduced-N,
    network, and non-analyst (int_/des_) cells are exempt.
  - chart/interaction robustness floor (Section 14; the deterministic no-browser floor for
    the chart/interaction JS the real-browser audits enforce only when Chrome is present):
    chart_no_fault_isolation (a single inline <script> mounting >=2 charts/interactions but
    with no try{ — one throw aborts the block and blanks every sibling chart + the hero,
    PIT-55) and chart_no_cdn_fallback (a Vega-CDN chart page calling vegaEmbed() with no
    `typeof vegaEmbed` guard / static-table fallback). WARN by default; ERROR on a
    computational/visual topic via _rsev. The render-truth audits (render_capture.js
    cascadeScriptAbort/brokenMaps, playtest_drive.js) stay authoritative when a browser runs.
  - chart authoring floors (Sections 17-19; deterministic no-browser greps over the inline
    chart <script> bodies + run_cells, for bugs the real-browser audits don't isolate):
    vega_dark_text_missing (Section 17 — a Vega chart sets a `subtitle` but no `subtitleColor`
    anywhere; on the always-on DARK stage the subtitle is invisible, PIT-62),
    pyodide_int64_dtype_trap (Section 18 — a runnable run_cells cell calls np.bincount( on an
    arg not cast to np.intp; Pyodide's 32-bit numpy throws int64->int32 though local Python
    passes, PIT-63), and vega_conditional_on_mark (Section 19 — a {condition:...} object on a
    Vega-Lite mark property, invalid VL that silently mis-positions labels, PIT-64). Each WARN
    by default; ERROR on the topic class where it matters via _rsev (17/19: visual or
    computational; 18: computational).
  - share-control floor (Section 20; deterministic no-browser grep over the inline <script>
    bodies): web_share_api_used (an inline <script> calls navigator.share(/navigator.canShare(;
    handing the Web Share API a File payload CRASHES the whole tab — a renderer-process crash
    try/catch cannot intercept, most reliably on a file:// preview — so use clipboard.write([
    ClipboardItem image+text]) + a writeText fallback + a Download link instead, PIT-66). WARN
    (topic-neutral — a share/copy-result control can appear on any blog).
  - autoplay-video performance cap (Section 21; deterministic no-browser count over index.html):
    too_many_autoplay_videos (more than the cap of non-hero/non-cinematic <video autoplay>
    elements — a card/entity deck autoplaying one clip per card decodes + composites all at once
    and tanks scroll performance, PIT-71). The hero cover + cinematic-bg videos (class stage-hero
    / hero-bg / hero-video / cin-bg / cin-stage) are EXCLUDED, so a legitimate handful (hero + bg
    + a few deliberate hook GIFs) passes; the fix is a static poster + play-on-hover / Intersection
    Observer lazy-play with a small concurrent cap. WARN (topic-neutral — a clip-heavy deck can
    appear on any blog).

No LLM, no network — pure deterministic checks.
